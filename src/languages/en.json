        "title": "About me",
        "p1": "I’m a backend-focused developer working mainly with Node.js and REST APIs, with an emphasis on maintainable code, debugging and understanding how systems behave in production. I enjoy designing APIs, modelling data and reasoning about edge cases rather than just making things “work”.",
        "p2": "My background in QA Automation gave me a strong foundation in logs, HTTP communication, API testing and incident analysis, which strongly influences how I approach backend development today. I tend to think in terms of reliability, failure scenarios and how technical decisions affect real users and production systems.",
        "p3": "Currently, I’m deepening my backend and infrastructure skills by building personal projects, working with Docker, MongoDB and Linux-based VPS environments, and reinforcing my knowledge of systems and networking to develop with a production-oriented mindset."
